* **Full-Stack** - The template comes with a full-stack implementation, including a robust backend and a responsive frontend. 

* **Reusable Template** - IGA can be easily tailored to fit the needs of different educational applications, making it a highly flexible and reusable template.

## Deployment: Blue-Green

Blue-Green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green. At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic.

### Metrics

**1. Server Load**

Tracks the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. It's an important indicator of the system's health, which could affect the performance and speed of the app.

**2. Memory**

Tracks the memory usage of the application. Ensuring efficient memory usage helps maintain the performance of the app.

**3. Compute**

Monitors the computational resources used by the app. This is an essential metric to ensure the app runs smoothly and efficiently.

**4. Latency**

Delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. High latency can negatively impact the user experience.

**5. Throughput**

The capacity of the app to process data per unit of time. High throughput means the app can handle more data, leading to better performance.
