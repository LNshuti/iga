# IGA

IGA is a robust, reusable iOS template focused on building a simple, yet powerful AI-powered iOS app. It is designed with UX best practices in mind and serves as an excellent starting point for developing full stack educational applications. With IGA, you can leverage the power of AI and build engaging, intelligent applications tailored to your unique educational needs.

## Features

* **AI-Powered** - The application is built with advanced AI capabilities, enabling it to provide interactive and personalized educational experiences.

* **UX-Design** - IGA adheres to the latest UX design best practices, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

* **Full-Stack** - The template comes with a full-stack implementation, including a robust backend and a responsive frontend. 

* **Reusable Template** - IGA can be easily tailored to fit the needs of different educational applications, making it a highly flexible and reusable template.

## Deployment: Blue-Green

Blue-Green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green. At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic.

## Monitoring

### Metrics

**1. Server Load**

Tracks the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. It's an important indicator of the system's health, which could affect the performance and speed of the app.

**2. Fraction of Non-Null Outputs**

This metric helps us track the amount of valid output provided by the app. Any dip in this metric could signal potential issues in the data or the app's logic.

**3. Fraction of Missing Input Values**

This metric is important to track the fraction of missing inputs from users or backend services. A high rate could mean potential issues in the app's functionality.

#### Software metrics 

**1. Memory**

Tracks the memory usage of the application. Ensuring efficient memory usage helps in maintaining the performance of the app.

**2. Compute**

Monitors the computational resources used by the app. This is an essential metric to ensure the app runs smoothly and efficiently.

**3. Latency**

This is the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. High latency can negatively impact the user experience.

**4. Throughput**

Throughput measures the capacity of the app to process data per unit of time. High throughput means the app can handle more data, leading to better performance.

**5. Server Load**

As mentioned earlier, it tracks the amount of work handled by the server. A high server load can lead to slower response times and performance degradation.
