## IGA

IGA is a typescript iOS/Android app powered by Groq. It is designed with User experience best practices in mind and can serve as a starting template for developing a full-stack ai-agent application. A key feature of any delightful application is speed. This app uses Groq, a Language Processing Unit framework for ultra-fast inference on language models. 

We follow good data engineering principles when designing the pipelines that the agent relies on. For handling structured data, we use the Instructor [framework](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).
